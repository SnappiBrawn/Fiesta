# Fiesta
This is Fiesta, a Web-based Event Management System built specifically for a college or university.
You can find a working demo of the same here -> techietribe.epizy.com

Development Notes:-
- The development was done on an Apache Web-Server using XAMPP.
- MySQL is used for the back-end.
- PHP mysqli is used for the backend integration.
- Minor degrees of Bootstrap employed. Rest of the CSS was mostly hand-written. (had fun learning all that)

Instructions to run the project on a local system
- Download and install XAMPP for your system. (link: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
- Move the project files to the XAMPP htdocs directory. (Final directory structure: "C:\xampp\htdocs\fiesta", fiesta holds the project files.)
- Configure your MySQL database on XAMPP's PHPMyAdmin. Add a database called fiesta_db, import the "fiesta_db.sql" file found in /sql.
- Ensure your Apache and MySQL modules are working, and navigate to the URL "localhost/fiesta" on your web-browser.

PS: This is literally my very first web project so go easy on me.
